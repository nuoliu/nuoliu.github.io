@article{mawhorter_inferring_2019,
	abstract = {Reconciliation methods are widely used to explain incongruence between a gene tree and species tree. However, the common approach of inferring maximum parsimony reconciliations (MPRs) relies on user-defined costs for each type of event, which can be difficult to estimate. Prior work has explored the relationship between event costs and maximum parsimony reconciliations in the duplication-loss and duplication-transfer-loss models, but no studies have addressed this relationship in the more complicated duplication-loss-coalescence model.},

@article{raghavan_microenvironment_2021,
	abstract = {Summary
Prognostically relevant RNA expression states exist in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), but our understanding of their drivers, stability, and relationship to therapeutic response is limited. To examine these attributes systematically, we profiled metastatic biopsies and matched organoid models at single-cell resolution. In vivo, we identify a new intermediate PDAC transcriptional cell state and uncover distinct site- and state-specific tumor microenvironments (TMEs). Benchmarking models against this reference map, we reveal strong culture-specific biases in cancer cell transcriptional state representation driven by altered TME signals. We restore expression state heterogeneity by adding back in vivo-relevant factors and show plasticity in culture models. Further, we prove that non-genetic modulation of cell state can strongly influence drug responses, uncovering state-specific vulnerabilities. This work provides a broadly applicable framework for aligning cell states across in vivo and ex vivo settings, identifying drivers of transcriptional plasticity and manipulating cell state to target associated vulnerabilities.},

@inproceedings{carothers_integer_2020,
	abstract = {Given a gene tree, a species tree, and an association between their leaves, the maximum parsimony reconciliation (MPR) problem seeks to find a mapping of the gene tree to the species tree that explains their incongruity using a biological model of evolutionary events. Unfortunately, when simultaneously accounting for gene duplication, gene loss, and coalescence, the MPR problem is NP-hard. While an exact algorithm exists, it can be problematic to use in practice due to time and memory requirements. In this work, we present an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation for solving the MPR problem when considering duplications, losses, and coalescence. Our experimental results on a simulated data set of 12 Drosophila species shows that our new algorithm is both accurate and scalable. Furthermore, in contrast to the existing exact algorithm, our formulation allows users to limit the maximum runtime and thus trade-off accuracy and scalability, making it an attractive choice for phylogenetic pipelines.},

However, the standard duplication-transfer-loss (DTL) model does not account for the fact that species trees are often not fully sampled and thus, from the perspective of reconciliation, a gene family may enter the species tree from the outside. Moreover, within the genome, genes are often rearranged, causing them to move to new syntenic regions.},

@article{mead_compressed_2023,
	abstract = {High-throughput phenotypic screens leveraging biochemical perturbations, high-content readouts, and complex multicellular models could advance therapeutic discovery yet remain constrained by limitations of scale. To address this, we establish a method for compressing screens by pooling perturbations followed by computational deconvolution. Conducting controlled benchmarks with a highly bioactive small molecule library and a high-content imaging readout, we demonstrate increased efficiency for compressed experimental designs compared to conventional approaches. To prove generalizability, we apply compressed screening to examine transcriptional responses of patient-derived pancreatic cancer organoids to a library of tumor-microenvironment (TME)-nominated recombinant protein ligands. Using single-cell RNA-seq as a readout, we uncover reproducible phenotypic shifts induced by ligands that correlate with clinical features in larger datasets and are distinct from reference signatures available in public databases. In sum, our approach enables phenotypic screens that interrogate complex multicellular models with rich phenotypic readouts to advance translatable drug discovery as well as basic biology.Competing Interest StatementA.K.S. reports compensation for consulting and/or SAB membership from Merck, Honeycomb Biotechnologies, Cellarity, Repertoire Immune Medicines, Hovione, Third Rock Ventures, Ochre Bio, FL82, Empress Therapeutics, Relation Therapeutics, Senda Biosciences, IntrECate biotherapeutics, Santa Ana Bio and Dahlia Biosciences unrelated to this work.
