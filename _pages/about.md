Hi! I am Nuo Liu (刘诺), people also know me as Ivy. I am a computational biology researcher, pursuing my Ph.D. in [Computational and Systems Biology (CSB)](https://csbphd.mit.edu/welcome-mit-computational-and-systems-biology-phd-program-csb) at MIT under the guidance of Professor [Alex Shalek](https://chemistry.mit.edu/profile/alex-k-shalek/). My research at the Shalek lab has span across multiple areas, all focused on development and application of single-cell technologies (experimental and computational) to better understand perturbation response on human cellular systems. I have been supported by [NIH training grant](https://csbphd.mit.edu/about-program/nih-t32-training-grant-nigms) and [internal graduate student fellowship](https://ludwigcenter.mit.edu/people/graduate-fellows) through the Koch Institute at MIT. At MIT, I have been involved with student organizations including [MIT-CHIEF](https://www.mitchief.org/), Graduate Student Council [External Affairs Board](https://sites.mit.edu/gsc-eab/), and graduate application assistance program for CSB.  

Before my Ph.D., I attended undergraduate at Harvey Mudd College, graduated with with a B.S. in [Mathematical and Computational Biology](https://www.hmc.edu/mathematics/program/math-comp-bio/) with honors in Computer Science and Biology. My interest in computational biology first started during college when I had the fortune to conduct research with Professor [Catherin McFadden](https://www.hmc.edu/biology/faculty-staff/mcfadden/) on evolutionary relationships of corals and with Professors [Ran Libeskind-Hadas](https://www.cmc.edu/academic/faculty/profile/ran-libeskind-hadas) and [Jessica Yi-Chieh Wu](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~yjw/) on algorithmic development for phylogenetic tree reconciliations. To gain more experience on translational research, I participated in summer research at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children Hospital through the [SMART program](https://www.bcm.edu/education/graduate-school-of-biomedical-sciences/degree-programs-and-certificates/student-development-programs/smart-program) where I developed deep learning models for predicting epigenetic reprogramming events (supervised by [Dr. Cristian Coarfa](https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/cristian-coarfa-19635)) and using linear programming to reconstruct
transcriptional evolution of tumors (supervised by [Dr. Pavel Sumazin](https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/pavel-sumazin-31446)).I was selected as a [finalist](https://www.hmc.edu/about/2020/01/13/cra-recognizes-student-researchers/) for the Computing Research Association (CRA) undergraduate research award.
