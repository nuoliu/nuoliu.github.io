Hi! I am Nuo Liu (刘诺), people also know me as Ivy. I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the [Goodarzi Lab](https://arcinstitute.org/labs/goodarzilab) at [Arc Institute](https://arcinstitute.org/) in Palo Alto, CA. My current research focuses on leveraging computational models to understand complex diseases and identify therapeutic targets, particularly vulnerabilities in cancers and Alzheimer's disease. I also work on applying foundation models and LLMs to generate biomedical reasoning. I spend my time between New York and the Bay Area.

I completed my Ph.D. in [Computational and Systems Biology (CSB)](https://csbphd.mit.edu/welcome-mit-computational-and-systems-biology-phd-program-csb) at MIT under the guidance of Professor [Alex Shalek](https://chemistry.mit.edu/profile/alex-k-shalek/). My research at the Shalek Lab spanned multiple areas focused on the development and application of single-cell technologies (experimental and computational) to better understand perturbation responses in human cellular systems. I was supported by the [NIH training grant](https://csbphd.mit.edu/about-program/nih-t32-training-grant-nigms) and an [internal graduate student fellowship](https://ludwigcenter.mit.edu/people/graduate-fellows) through the Koch Institute at MIT. At MIT, I was involved with student organizations including [MIT-CHIEF](https://www.mitchief.org/), Graduate Student Council [External Affairs Board](https://sites.mit.edu/gsc-eab/), and the graduate application assistance program for CSB.

Before my Ph.D., I attended Harvey Mudd College, graduating with a B.S. in [Mathematical and Computational Biology](https://www.hmc.edu/mathematics/program/math-comp-bio/) with honors in Computer Science and Biology. My interest in computational biology first started during college when I had the fortune to conduct research with Professor [Catherine McFadden](https://www.hmc.edu/biology/faculty-staff/mcfadden/) on evolutionary relationships of corals and with Professors [Ran Libeskind-Hadas](https://www.cmc.edu/academic/faculty/profile/ran-libeskind-hadas) and [Jessica Yi-Chieh Wu](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~yjw/) on algorithmic development for phylogenetic tree reconciliations. To gain more experience in translational research, I participated in summer research at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital through the [SMART program](https://www.bcm.edu/education/graduate-school-of-biomedical-sciences/degree-programs-and-certificates/student-development-programs/smart-program), where I developed deep learning models for predicting epigenetic reprogramming events (supervised by [Dr. Cristian Coarfa](https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/cristian-coarfa-19635)) and used linear programming to reconstruct transcriptional evolution of tumors (supervised by [Dr. Pavel Sumazin](https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/pavel-sumazin-31446)). I was selected as a [finalist](https://www.hmc.edu/about/2020/01/13/cra-recognizes-student-researchers/) for the Computing Research Association (CRA) undergraduate research award.

Outside of research, I enjoy pottery, painting, calligraphy, traveling, and hunting for the best matcha lattes.
